<h5>Data storage</h5>
I store emails and usernames in plaintext in the database, but passwords are hashed to be unreadable. Access to this database is very limited.
<br>
There is only one cookie which is used to determine if you want to stay logged in.
<br>
Nothing else about users is tracked or stored.
<br>
<h5 class="mt-5">Removing data</h5>
All data will be deleted within a week of the CTF ending on the 29th June.
<br>If you would like to delete it sooner email involuntary@involuntaryCTF.net and I will delete it.
