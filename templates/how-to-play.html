      The aim of a CTF is to find flags through your technical and problem-solving prowess. There will be a series of
      challenges for you to complete starting from simple and growing much harder. Each challenge will be hiding a flag
      in
      the format <code>!FLAG!{flag_text_here}!FLAG!</code> which will be hidden in: a database, cipher text, locked
      behind a login
      page, hidden in an image, or many other challenges you'll face. When you find the flag enter it into the flag box
      and you'll increase your score, the harder the challenge the more points you'll get.

      Each challenge is possible to solve through free and open source tools, methods and information (since that's how
      I made them), so just keep researching and testing new things and you can get it eventually.<br /> <br />
      There are many different areas of challenges which will test different skills, so even if you don't know much
      programming or web-development you might be able to solve cryptographic challenges much more based on maths and
      problem solving.
